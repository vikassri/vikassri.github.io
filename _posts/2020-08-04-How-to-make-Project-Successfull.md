Making a project successful is not an easy task. There are many points which need to keep in mind while working on any project. I have pointed out some of them, which I think are important for any new project.

## **Points

* **Project goal**
* **Determine the audience**
* **Core component/feature**
* **Right technology**
* **Basic functionality**
* **Testing with audience**
* **Iterate the process**


## **Determine the project goal**
This is the first step, where you have to define the goals of the project. Before you start the project analyse the requirement and figure out what will be the objective of the project.

## **Determine the audience**
Second step, Is you need to figure the target audience of the project like who is going to use and from where they are going to use. What kind of medium they are going to use for this Application mobile App / Destop etc

## **Core component/feature of your project**
There should be good reason why you are building this project. What are the core components of the project. Which will be base line of the project or you can say necessory component of the projects.

## **Choose the right technology**
Always try to choose techonology Stack which supports your core component and use it. Always Give preference to those which you already know it always saves you lot of time.

## **Basic functionality**

Always make Initial version with basic functionality using your core components. It should serve the basic purpose of the project. Take the feedback from the audience who is going to use this Application. This will help you in going into right direction which path you should take.


## **Test it with audience**
Once you have the initial version with you, Take it to Audience and take the feedback and keep it check if these are already in your list if not remove the uncessory and add the Audience recommendation features.

## **Iterate the process**

Repeat the process of development and taking the feedback from the audience. Implement the changes and add the new recommended features
Iterate the process of development w.r.t audience feedback till you make it successfull.
