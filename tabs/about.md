Ever since I was a kid, I was always very fasinated about the technology, Specially gadgets. Whenever I see some robot or any toy I used to think how its working, what is the technology behind it. I always stick around computers and spend hours to play game or do something, Apart from computer I loved playing `Cricket` and `T.T`. I was not so good with studies, well good enough to clear my exams :).

I did B.E from Raj. University in I.T (2008). I got good grades and successfully launced social networking website. 

Started my career in 2008 and still eagar to learn new things :).
